# Digitally Enabled Equitably Placed (DEEP) Facility  
Tools for optimizing placement of health workers and services based on village locations.  

## Prerequisites
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads) 3.12 or higher.
- [Python virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/)

## Setup
This section describes how to set up the tool and the demo web app.
 
1. Activate your Python virtual environment and upgrade pip and build tools.
```bash
# Update pip and build package.
pip install --upgrade pip  
pip install --upgrade build
pip install --upgrade setuptools
```

2. [Clone this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) or [download](https://github.com/InstituteforDiseaseModeling/deepfacility/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract the source code. Then open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the source code.
```bash
# Navigate to the root directory.
cd deepfacility
``` 

3. Install the tool:  
```bash
# Install the tool and required packages. 
pip install -e .
```

## Getting Started

Start the demo web app:
```bash
# Start the demo web app using `ux` command.
deepfacility ux
````

After you see the message `Serving on ...` the **demo** web app is running.   

Follow these steps to experience the workflow end-to-end:
- Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to access the **demo** web app.
- Follow instructions to "upload" and configure village locations .csv file.
  - _Note that this app is running on your local machine and all files are stored locally._ 
- Click `Prepare Data` to download and prepare input data: households and commune shapes. 
- Select locations (communes) and click `Run Clustering` to start the processing.
- Visualize and explore village shapes and health facilities recommendations on a map.
- Obtain the results file.

_Notes_: 
- _This web app is only for **demo** purposes and is **not** intended for production use._
- _To start a fresh copy of the app, without cached data, run `deepfacility reset` command before starting the app._

# Terminology
In this repository, we use the following terms and abbreviations:

- `Cluster` and `Village` refer to the same entity with small differences in context:
  - Cluster: a group of households. 
  - Village: spatial interpretation of a cluster.
- `Location`: an administrative area where the clustering is performed.
  - In this tool a location value is a colon-separated list of names of administrative levels, per [configuration](docs/design.md#locations).
  - For example, in Burkina Faso:
    - `Tapoa:Diapaga` represents the `Diapaga` commune from the `Tapoa` province.
    - `Tapoa:Diapaga:Mangou` represents a village from the `Diapaga` commune. 

- Abbreviations:
  - Health Facilities (HF)
  - Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (eCDF)

# Multi-Language Support
By default, the demo web app supports French and English languages. To add a support for additional languages see [Add New Language](docs/design.md#adding-new-languages) section in the design document.
